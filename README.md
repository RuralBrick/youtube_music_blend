# YouTube Music Blend

Have you wondered how Spotify's Blend experience might look like on YouTube
Music? This CLI tool + Python library provides all the functionality you need to
generate Blends between you and all your friends (plus a few more interesting
ways to look at and combine your playlists)!

## Installation

This repository can be directly installed by using pip in your favorite terminal
with the command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/RuralBrick/youtube_music_blend.git
```
Both the YouTube Music Blend library and `ytmb` CLI tool will be installed into
your current terminal environment.

## Usage

After installing YouTube Music Blend, you can call the CLI tool by simply typing
`ytmb` into your terminal. `ytmb` is fully interactive, so just follow the
prompts to use it out-of-the-box!

If you wish to use YouTube Music Blend as a library, you can import its modules
in Python from the `ytmb` package.
